FoodShare

My Code Louisville FSJS Project. A web app designed to let users share food items or leftovers that they will not use before it expires or before it is thrown away.  The primary end goal would be to keep edible food out of the landfill.  User can add items to the web add, edit or delete their items, and in the future contact other users.


Steps to get FoodShare up and running:
  Download the project files
  Go to root directory of project
  Add .env to root directory
  Run ‘npm install’ to install necessary packages
  Run ‘mongod’ to start mongo service
  Run ‘npm start’ to begin the app server process
  Open a localhost windows to the port it’s running on
  Go to the sign up panel and enter fake info to the sign up info and press submit
  Click submit then you will be taken to the account page where you can use CRUD functions
